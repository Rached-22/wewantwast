# Wewantwast - Skip Selection UI/UX Optimization

This React-based project focuses on optimizing the **"Select Skip"** page for better user experience and responsiveness. This UI is part of a waste management system where users can choose the appropriate skip size based on availability, cost, and site constraints (e.g., if a skip is allowed on the street).

## âœ¨ Optimized Features

- **Responsive Grid Layout** for skip cards
- **Filter functionality** by skip size and cost
- **Search by skip name**
- **Visual badge indicators** for skips that are *not allowed on street*
- **Card selection highlighting**
- **No horizontal scroll issues** â€” fully mobile and tablet-friendly
- **Live configuration summary **** Each stepâ€™s selections are aggregated into a recap section below the stepper, ensuring users have full visibility and validation of their configured skip details before final submission.
